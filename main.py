# Problem 22:
#     Names Scores
#
# Description:
#     Using names.txt (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'),
#       a 46K text file containing over five-thousand first names,
#       begin by sorting it into alphabetical order.
#
#     Then working out the alphabetical value for each name,
#       multiply this value by its alphabetical position in the list to obtain a name score.
#
#     For example, when the list is sorted into alphabetical order,
#       "COLIN", which is worth 3 + 15 + 12 + 9 + 14 = 53,
#       is the 938th name in the list.
#
#     So, COLIN would obtain a score of 938 Ã— 53 = 49714.
#
#     What is the total of all the name scores in the file?

# Delta to convert from ordinal char value to uppercase letter's number value
